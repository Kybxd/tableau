// Package functest is aimed for Functional Testing.
//
// "Functional Testing" is a black box testing technique, where
// the functionality of the application is tested to generate
// the desired output on providing a certain input.
//
// Test cases basically comprise of the following parts:
// 	- Test Summary
//	- Prerequisites (if any)
//	- Test case input steps
//	- Test data (if any)
// 	- Expected output
// 	- Notes (if any)
//
// “Requirement-Based” and “Business scenario-based” are the two
// forms of functional testing that are carried out.
//
// In Requirement based testing, test cases are created as per the
// requirement and tested accordingly. In a Business scenario based
// functional testing, testing is performed by keeping in mind all
// the scenarios from a business perspective.
